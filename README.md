# agent-eda

Deterministic exploratory data analysis (EDA) for pandas DataFrames, built for LLM agents and usable by people.

> Status: version 0.1, in development and not yet on PyPI. It ships 11 first-look analyses, four discovery functions and an optional `Project` for masking sensitive columns. The [catalogue](docs/eda-python-implementation-catalogue.md) lists the analyses planned next.

Each analysis is a plain Python function. It takes a DataFrame and typed keyword arguments and returns a typed result that prints as a short text summary. The library never calls an LLM or the network, so the same data and arguments always give the same result, down to the byte.

It is written for three kinds of callers:

- agents in AWS Bedrock AgentCore, through its Code Interpreter
- coding agents such as Claude Code
- people, who use it like any other package

## Features

- **11 first-look analyses**: structure, column types, missing values, placeholder codes such as -999, distributions, duplicates, keys, the target and associations.
- **Results you can read and parse**: `print(res)` gives at most 40 lines of text, `res.to_frame()` the full tables and `res.to_json()` the whole record as strict JSON.
- **Findings, not just numbers**: each result lists what it noticed, such as "1 value in 1 column may stand in for missing values: 'age'".
- **Discovery for agents**: `ae.guide()`, `ae.search_analyses()` and `ae.describe_analysis()` explain the package from inside Python.
- **Helpful errors**: a misspelled column name raises an error that lists the available columns and the closest match.
- **Opt-in masking** of sensitive columns, such as e-mail addresses, in everything a result shows.
- **Pure Python** on numpy, pandas, pydantic, SciPy, scikit-learn and statsmodels, all preinstalled in AgentCore Code Interpreter.

## Installation

agent-eda needs Python 3.12 or later. It runs with numpy 1.26 through 2.x and pandas 2.2 through 3.x.

Until 0.1 is on PyPI, build the wheel in a clone of this repository with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```sh
uv build --wheel  # writes dist/agent_eda-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
pip install dist/agent_eda-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

Once it is released, `pip install agent-eda` is enough.

**AgentCore Code Interpreter.** In public network mode, run `pip install agent-eda` in the session. In sandbox mode the session can't reach PyPI: upload the wheel and run `pip install --no-deps <wheel>`, or, if pip is blocked, put the wheel file on `sys.path` and import from it directly. Installs don't carry over to a new session. Code Interpreter returns only printed output, so always `print()` results.

**AgentCore Runtime.** Add `agent-eda` to the agent's container image or code zip. AWS's example zip command uses the `manylinux2014` platform tag, which installs old numpy and pandas releases; use `--python-platform aarch64-manylinux_2_28` to get current ones.

## Quick start

Pass the DataFrame first and every other argument by keyword. There is nothing to set up, and analyses never change the DataFrame.

```python
import pandas as pd

import agent_eda as ae

names = ["ann", "bo", "cy", "di", "ed", "flo", "gus", "bo"]
df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "customer_id": [101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108],
        "email": [f"{name}@example.com" for name in names],
        "age": [34, 51, -999, 29, 45, 38, 62, 51],
        "income": [42_000, 58_500, 61_000, None, 39_500, 75_000, 52_000, 58_500],
        "plan": ["basic", "pro", "basic", "Basic ", "pro", "basic", None, "pro"],
        "churned": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    }
)

res = ae.summarize_numeric(df, columns=["age", "income"])
print(res)
```

It prints:

```text
summarize_numeric: completed on 8 rows x 6 columns
Statistics use the finite values. Quantile method linear; trimmed_mean cuts 10% from each end.
res.to_frame() also has the quantiles, trimmed_mean, mad, mad_scaled, skewness and excess_kurtosis.
Columns (2 of 2 shown):
column  count  missing_count       mean       std       min    median      max
age         8              0     -86.12       369      -999      41.5       62
income      7              1  5.521e+04  1.21e+04  3.95e+04  5.85e+04  7.5e+04
Findings: none
Limitations: none
More: res.to_frame() has all 2 columns; res.findings, res.limitations and res.to_json() have the rest.
```

The mean age of -86.12 is the first sign of trouble. The sample data hides three problems: a -999 that stands for a missing age, a plan written both `'basic'` and `'Basic '`, and one customer recorded twice, under the IDs 102 and 108.

## Analyses

The analyses are listed in the order `ae.guide()` suggests for a first look at a new dataset. Most need nothing but the DataFrame. The ones that need project knowledge, such as your schema or your target, ask for it; they never guess it.

| Step | Analysis | What it answers | Required arguments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `describe_dataset` | What does this dataset contain? | none |
| 2 | `infer_column_semantics` | What kind of values does each column hold? | none |
| 2 | `validate_column_types` | Do the columns hold the logical types I declared? | `schema` |
| 3 | `profile_missing_values` | How much data is missing, and where? | none |
| 4 | `detect_missing_sentinels` | Which values look like stand-ins for missing data? | none |
| 5 | `summarize_numeric` | How are the values in each numeric column distributed? | none |
| 5 | `summarize_categorical` | Which values occur in each categorical column, and how often? | none |
| 6 | `find_duplicate_rows` | Are there exact duplicate rows? | none |
| 6 | `find_candidate_keys` | Which columns, alone or combined, uniquely identify rows? | none |
| 7 | `profile_target` | What does the target look like for this task? | `target_column`, `task` |
| 8 | `compute_association_matrix` | How strongly are pairs of columns associated? | none |

Every analysis that works column by column takes `columns=` to limit it to some columns; the default uses every column it can. `help(ae.<name>)` and `ae.describe_analysis("<name>")` show all the options.

Run all 11 on the sample data and print what they suspect:

```python
schema = {"customer_id": "integer", "age": "integer", "plan": "categorical"}
results = [
    ae.describe_dataset(df),
    ae.infer_column_semantics(df),
    ae.validate_column_types(df, schema=schema),
    ae.profile_missing_values(df),
    ae.detect_missing_sentinels(df, id_column="customer_id"),
    ae.summarize_numeric(df),
    ae.summarize_categorical(df),
    ae.find_duplicate_rows(df, id_column="customer_id"),
    ae.find_candidate_keys(df),
    ae.profile_target(df, target_column="churned", task="binary_classification"),
    ae.compute_association_matrix(df),
]
for res in results:
    for finding in res.findings:
        if finding.assessment == "suspected":
            print(f"{res.analysis}: {finding.claim}")
```

```text
infer_column_semantics: 1 column looks like an identifier, every value distinct: 'customer_id'.
detect_missing_sentinels: 1 value in 1 column may stand in for missing values: 'age'.
summarize_categorical: 1 column holds labels that differ only by case or surrounding spaces: 'plan'.
find_duplicate_rows: 2 rows form 1 duplicate group; 1 is an excess copy (duplicate_share 0.125).
compute_association_matrix: 3 pairs are perfectly associated, an absolute value of 1, so one column may duplicate or derive from the other: ('email', 'age'), ('email', 'income') and ('email', 'churned').
```

The second, third and fourth lines are the three planted problems. The other two are worth a glance but expected here: `customer_id` is meant to be an identifier, and `email` is unique for all but the duplicated customer, so it "predicts" every other column perfectly. A finding says what the data suggests; deciding what it means is your call.

## Discovery

Four functions describe the package from inside Python, so an agent can start without reading the source:

| Function | What it gives you |
| --- | --- |
| `ae.guide()` | Prints one page: how to call an analysis and read its result, every analysis, and the first-look order. |
| `ae.search_analyses(query)` | The analyses that best match a question in your own words, such as "nulls per column". |
| `ae.describe_analysis(name)` | An analysis's parameters, statuses, result fields, finding codes and an example. |
| `ae.list_analyses()` | Every analysis with its module, question and masking support; `.to_frame()` gives a table. |

```python
ae.guide()
print(ae.search_analyses("nulls per column"))
print(ae.describe_analysis("profile_missing_values"))
```

## Reading a result

Every result has the same shared fields, next to its own:

- `res.status` says how the run ended: `completed`, `partial`, `insufficient_data`, `not_applicable`, `missing_prerequisites`, `budget_exceeded`, `blocked_by_policy` or `failed`. `res.status_reason` says why it didn't complete.
- `res.findings` are claims about the data, each with a `code`, a `claim` and an `assessment`: `descriptive`, `suspected`, `violation`, `passed` or `unknown`.
- `res.limitations` say what limits how far the numbers can be read, such as too few values for a statistic.
- `res.parameters` records every argument the analysis used, defaults included.

```python
res = ae.summarize_numeric(df, columns=["age", "income"])
table = res.to_frame()  # every statistic of every column, as a DataFrame
record = res.to_json()  # the whole result as strict JSON
age = res.columns["age"]  # typed fields, such as age.median and age.std
```

The printed text stays within 40 lines of 120 characters however large the data, and says what it leaves out. Lists that grow with the data are capped in the JSON record too, and carry their totals.

A mistake in a call, such as a misspelled column or an unknown option, raises a subclass of `ae.errors.AgentEDAError` before any work starts. Each error has a stable `code`, and its message says what is wrong and how to fix it. Problems in the data never raise; they show up in the status, the findings and the limitations.

## Projects and masking

Five analyses can show raw values, such as the labels `summarize_categorical` counts or the row IDs `find_duplicate_rows` lists: `validate_column_types`, `detect_missing_sentinels`, `summarize_categorical`, `find_duplicate_rows` and `profile_target`. They take `project=` and `mask_sensitive=`, and `ae.guide()` marks them `[supports masking]`.

A `Project` holds settings that stay the same across calls. Its data policy names the sensitive columns, and masking replaces their values with numbered placeholders. Counts and shares stay:

```python
policy = ae.DataPolicy(sensitive_columns=["email"], mask_sensitive=True)
project = ae.Project(name="churn", data_policy=policy)
print(ae.summarize_categorical(df, columns=["email"], project=project))
```

```text
summarize_categorical: completed on 8 rows x 6 columns
Masked (data_policy.mask_sensitive=True): the values of column 'email' show as <masked 1>, <masked 2> and so on; counts
    and shares are unaffected.
Shares are of each column's non-missing values. Levels go by count, then label; most_common_levels has the top 10.
Columns (1 of 1 shown):
column  non_missing_count  missing_count  cardinality  most_common_levels
email                   8              0            7  <masked 1>: 2 (25%), <masked 2>: 1 (12.5%), <masked 3>: 1 (12....
Findings: none
Limitations: none
More: res.to_frame() has all 7 levels; res.findings, res.limitations and res.to_json() have the rest.
```

How masking is decided:

- It is off by default, even for columns declared sensitive.
- `mask_sensitive=True` in the data policy switches it on for every call that gets the project.
- `mask_sensitive=True` or `False` in a call overrides the project for that call.
- It covers the printed text, `to_dict()`, `to_json()` and `to_frame()` alike.
- It never touches numeric statistics, such as a minimum, or index labels. Pass a non-sensitive `id_column` when the index holds sensitive values.

Save the project once and load it in every later script, which helps an agent that runs each script in a new process:

```python
project.save("project.toml")
project = ae.Project.load("project.toml")
```

`project.toml` is plain TOML that you can edit by hand:

```toml
# An agent-eda Project. Load it with ae.Project.load(path).
name = "churn"

[data_policy]
sensitive_columns = [
    "email",
]
mask_sensitive = true
```

Masking is a guardrail against accidental exposure, not anonymization or access control. The package runs in the agent's own Python process, so an agent that can call it can also read the data directly. [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-data-policy-is-a-guardrail.md) records why.

## Development

The project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Clone the repository, then install the package with its dev tools and the git hooks:

```sh
uv sync
uv run pre-commit install
```

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Lint | `uv run ruff check .` |
| Format | `uv run ruff format .` |
| Type check | `uv run ty check` |
| Test | `uv run pytest` |
| Test on the minimum versions | `uv run --isolated --resolution lowest-direct --no-group mcp --group core --python 3.12 pytest` |
| Test on the minimum versions with the mcp extra | `uv run --isolated --resolution lowest-direct --extra mcp --python 3.12 pytest` |
| Test with more generated examples | `uv run pytest --hypothesis-profile=thorough` |
| Test with coverage | `uv run pytest --cov` |
| Benchmark | `uv run pytest -m benchmark` |
| Build the wheel | `uv build --wheel` |
| Run all hooks | `uv run pre-commit run --all-files` |

Notes on the less obvious commands:

- **Minimum versions.** The run installs every dependency at the lowest version `pyproject.toml` allows (numpy 1.26, pandas 2.2, pydantic 2.7, scipy 1.11.2, scikit-learn 1.5, statsmodels 0.14.1) into a throwaway environment on Python 3.12, without the mcp extra, whose tests skip. The second run adds the extra at its floors (mcp 2.3 and pyarrow 14), and with them the pydantic 2.12 that mcp needs, so it runs the whole suite. Keep `--isolated`; without it, uv rewrites `uv.lock`.
- **The mcp extra.** `uv sync` and `uv run` install it, so `uv run pytest` runs the MCP server tests. This needs uv 0.13 or later, the version CI and the hooks use; uv 0.10 leaves the extra out unless you pass `--extra mcp`.
- **Property tests.** Hypothesis calls every analysis on generated DataFrames full of edge cases. It runs derandomized: 50 examples per analysis, or 1,000 with the `thorough` profile.
- **Benchmark.** It times every analysis with default arguments on a deterministic DataFrame of 1,000,000 rows and 100 mixed columns, with BLAS and pyarrow limited to 2 threads, and fails any analysis that takes 5 seconds or more. The default test run skips it.
- **README.** `tests/test_readme.py` runs this README's python examples in order and fails when a `text` block right after one differs from what it prints. It also checks the analyses table against `ae.guide()`.
- **New analyses** need a recipe in `tests/recipes.py`, or the suite fails and says so. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) has the rules every analysis follows.

The pre-commit hooks run ruff, ty and file checks on every commit, and the tests on `git push`. On GitHub, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs lint, type checks and the tests on Python 3.12 to 3.14 on Linux x86_64 and ARM64, the minimum-versions run, and a packaging job that installs the wheel offline with only the required dependencies. The benchmark runs only when started by hand from the Actions tab.
